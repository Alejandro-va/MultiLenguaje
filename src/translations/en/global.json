Ho! ho! quoth he, that's for me,and soon rooted it out from beneath the straw. What did it turn out to be but a Pearl that by some chance had been lost in the yard? You may be a treasure,quoth Master Cock, to men that prize you, but for me I would rather have a single barley-corn than a peck of pearls. Precious things are for those that can prize them."

      "content-pg2":"A Fox once saw a Crow fly off with a piece of cheese in its beak and settle on a branch of a tree. \"That's for me, as I am a Fox,\" said Master Reynard, and he walked up to the foot of the tree.  \"Good-day, Mistress Crow,\" he cried. \"How well you are looking to-day: how glossy your feathers; how bright your eye. I feel sure your voice must surpass that of other birds, just as your figure does; let me hear but one song from you that I may greet you as the Queen of Birds.\" The Crow lifted up her head and began to caw her best, but the moment she opened her mouth the piece of cheese fell to the ground, only to be  snapped up by Master Fox. \"That will do,\" said he. \"That was all I wanted. In exchange for your cheese I will give you a piece of advice for the future. \"Do not trust flatterers.\""

      "content-pg3":"At one time the Fox and the Stork were on visiting terms and seemed very good friends. So the Fox invited the Stork to dinner, and for a joke put nothing before her but some soup in a very shallow dish. This the Fox could easily lap up, but the Stork could only wet the end of her long bill in it, and left the meal as hungry as when she began. \"I am sorry, \" said the Fox, \"the soup is not to your liking.\" \"Pray do not apologise,\" said the Stork. \"I hope you will return this visit, and come and dine with me soon.\"  So a day was appointed when the Fox should visit the Stork; but when they were seated at table all that was for their dinner was contained in a  very long-necked jar with a narrow mouth, in which the Fox could not insert his snout, so all he could manage to do was to lick the outside of  the jar. \"I will not apologise for the dinner,\" said the Stork: \"One bad turn deserves another.\" "
